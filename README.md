Spring 2021 GWU DATS6101 Model Housing Prices
 Description and SMART Questions

Housing prices are an important indicator that reflects the performance of the economy. 
Real estate developers and home buyers pay close attention to housing price fluctuations. 
The establishment of a real estate price prediction system is a key task for the healthy development of the current real estate industry. 
Having a simple predictive and inferential method to model housing prices helps commerce determine fair prices and allows governments to determine property taxes. 
This project aims to learn how different factors may affect home sales price by building linear models. 
Although data that will be utilized was collected in Melbourne, Australia in 2017, the concept that location and home attributes correlate with housing prices could reasonably apply broadly and internationally. 
The following questions are the main subjects which this project focuses on:

1. Understand if housing prices in Melbourne, Australia can be predicted using this dataset.
2. Determine what variables have the greatest impact on housing price.
3. Analyze the impacts of location, seller, and construction attributes of homes on the housing market in Melbourne, Australia. 

Data Source 
The dataset in this project has more than 3600 observations with 21 variables.
